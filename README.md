## Assingment Week 3

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

The rubric contains the following two questions:

1. Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?

2. Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?
